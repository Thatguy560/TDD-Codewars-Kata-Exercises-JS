## Find The Parity Outlier Kata

### Requirements 

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

### Test Cases

```JavaScript
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)
```

### Input/Output Table

| Input                            | Output     |
| :------------------------------- | :--------  |
| [0,1,2]                  |  1         | 
| [1,2,3]                  |   2        | 
| [2,6,8,10,3]                 | 3           |
