Your task is to split the string into separate digits:

```"zero nine one one eight two seven three six four two five"```

### Test Cases

```JavaScript
"three"              -->  "three"

"fivefourseven"      -->  "five four seven"
"ninethreesixthree"  -->  "nine three six three"
"fivethreefivesixthreenineonesevenoneeight"  -->  "five three five six three nine one seven one eight"
```
