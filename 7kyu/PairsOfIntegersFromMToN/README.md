## Pairs of integers from m to n Kata

### Requirements 

Implement a function that receives two integers m and n and generates a sorted list of pairs (a, b) such that m <= a <= b <= n.

Example:

### Test Cases

For example, start with 87:

```JavaScript
m = 2
n = 4

result = [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
```

4884 is a palindrome and we needed 4 steps to obtain it, so answer for 87 is 4.

### Input/Output Table

| Input      | Output |
| :----------| :----- |
| (2,4)      | [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]     |
